# Tea Manufacturing Relational Database
The Tea Manufacturing Relational Database is the creation of a hypothetical relational database a tea vendor may use to keep track of particular teas, manufacturing information, and geographical information about growers. This data base is written in mySQL.

There are four items contained in this folder:

ea.v4.sql: The sql code used to construct a database of tea-manufacturing information.

NOTE: The information provided is completely false data and is not related to any real-world infomation. I created false data for the purpose of learning how to create a database in mysql.

Tea.mwb and tea.mwb.bak: These files are needed to create a visual schema of the database in mysql.

phase4.sql: A series of SQL queries I created for the tea database.
